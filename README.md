Cookiecutter Data Project Repositories Structure Template
==============================
[cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) is a 'logical, reasonably standardized, but flexible project structure for doing and sharing data science work.'
It helps with projects reproducibility, code quality and collaboration within data science teams. This fork of the main structure is a barebone structure that can be further customized to answer not only data science
needs but also analytics engineering or even ad-hoc analysis projects as well.

This template creates a custom repository structure for all your data projects. It is released under the MIT license so feel free to use it for all yours projects.

A few choices have been made regarding its content:
* The [pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library for Python dependencies management is used by default. One could easily replace it with other choices like Poetry.
* To check the quality of our code follows pep8 standards, we use [flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/).
* We use a [Makefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makefile) to run recurring commands (linter, requirements). More can be added once installed.


### Prerequisites
------------
  - [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)
  ```bash
  $ pip install cookiecutter
  ```


### Install the structure in a new empty project folder
------------
```bash
$ cookiecutter https://github.com/GuillaumeLegoy/data-projects-template.git
```


### Once inside your project, run the following to install dependencies (only flake8 by default):
------------
```bash
$ make requirements
```


### To make sure your code follows pep8 standards run the following inside your project:
------------
```bash
$ make lint
```


### Directory structure
------------
```
├── /src                <- Source code for use in this project.
│   └── __init__.py     <- Makes src a Python module
│
├── /test
│
├── Makefile           <- Makefile with commands like `make data` or `make train`
├── README.md          <- The top-level README for developers using this project.
